This operation will generate a private key, storing it in the account, generating a DID, DID Document, and publishing it to the Tangle.

The only way to update or delete an identity is by publishing a new version, which we will discuss in the next section. This immutability is what makes a Decentralized Identity solution based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) trustworthy.
